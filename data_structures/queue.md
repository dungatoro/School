# Queue

Queues are a 'LILO' data structure (last in, last out) - the most recent 
additions to the queue can only be accessed again once the rest of the queue has
been dequeued. This is in contrast to 'LIFO' that a [[stack]] uses.

There a few different implementations of queues, a [[na√Øve_queue]], a 
[[linear_queue]], or a [[circular_queue]].

# Stack

A stack is a 'LIFO' data structure (last in, first out). Data is not read or 
wrote by index but instead new data is 'pushed' to the top and data is 'popped' 
from the top to access.

## Pointer

A stack has a pointer that sits at the top, pushing moves it up, popping moves it 
down. 

## PUSH



## POP

Popping usually does not actually remove items, just decrement the pointer.

# Stack

A stack is a 'LIFO' data structure (last in, first out). This is in contrast to 
'FIFO' that a [[queue]] uses. New data is 'pushed' to the top while reading data
means 'popping' the element at the top.

## Pointer

A stack has a pointer that sits at the top, pushing moves it up, popping moves it 
down. 

## PUSH



## POP

Popping usually does not actually remove items, just decrement the pointer.
